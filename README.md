# India Inflation Deep-Dive: Decoding the 2019 Supply Shock & COVID-19 Impact (2013-2023)
Quantitative analysis of India's CPI (2013-2023). Decodes the 2019 supply-side shock, quantifies COVID-19 sector volatility, and models the 0.97 correlation between global crude oil and domestic inflation.

## 🚀 Executive Summary
This project analyzes 10 years of India's Consumer Price Index (CPI) data to isolate the root causes of inflation volatility. Moving beyond basic trend analysis, this study separates **supply-side shocks** from **demand-side pressure**.

**Key Quantitative Findings:**
* **The 2019 Anomaly:** Identified that the 2019 inflation spike was **not demand-driven** but a **supply-side shock** caused by a **60% YoY surge in vegetable prices**, while core inflation remained relatively stable.
* **Global Sensitivity:** Calculated a **Pearson Correlation Coefficient of 0.97** between global crude oil events and domestic fuel prices, quantifying India's high sensitivity to imported energy inflation.
* **Pandemic Decoupling:** Analysis of the COVID-19 period (2020-2021) reveals a "K-shaped" divergence where Transport and Health sectors saw inflation rise despite a general economic slowdown.

## 📊 Visual Analysis

### 1. The 2019 Supply-Side Shock

## 🛠️ Technical Approach & Methodology
* **Data Processing:** Cleaned and normalized monthly CPI datasets (Rural, Urban, Combined) from 2013-2023, handling missing values in early rural datasets to ensure time-series continuity.
* **Statistical Modeling:** Applied Year-on-Year (YoY) growth calculations to smooth out seasonal volatility and identify true inflationary trends.
* **Correlation Analysis:** Performed statistical correlation tests to validate the relationship between external global markers (Crude Oil) and internal CPI components.

## 💡 Strategic Implication
This analysis suggests that **monetary policy (interest rate hikes)** may be less effective against inflation spikes similar to 2019, as these were driven by **logistics and crop cycles (Supply Side)** rather than excess consumer liquidity (Demand Side). Policy interventions focusing on supply-chain resilience would yield better stability than purely monetary tightening for such anomalies.
