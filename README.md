# India Inflation Deep-Dive (2013–2023)

**Quantitative analysis of India’s CPI to identify supply-side shocks, COVID-era distortions, and exposure to global crude oil prices.**

**Key signals uncovered:**
- 2019 inflation spike driven by **supply-side food shock**, not demand.
- **0.97 correlation** between global crude oil prices and domestic fuel inflation.
- COVID period shows **sectoral decoupling** in essential services.

## 📊 Key Questions & Analytical Insights

### Q1: What is the current composition of the CPI basket?
**Answer:**
Food & Beverages dominate India’s CPI basket, making food inflation the primary driver of headline CPI movements. This heavy weighting means agricultural output has a disproportionate impact on India's economic stability compared to other sectors.

### Q2: What are the historical inflation trends and anomalies (2017 onwards)?
**Answer:**
The highest YoY inflation spike in the last decade (2019) was linked to **structural and supply-driven factors**, not sustained demand pressure. The data reveals a sharp divergence where headline inflation spiked while core inflation remained relatively stable.

### Q3: How has Food Inflation behaved in the last 12 months?
**Answer:**
Food inflation shows sharp month-on-month volatility, with a **single sub-category acting as the dominant contributor** during peak months. This confirms that short-term inflation in India is often "item-specific" (e.g., tomatoes or cereals) rather than broad-based.

### Q4: What was the impact of COVID-19 on sector-specific inflation?
**Answer:**
During COVID-19 (post-March 2020), essential sectors such as **Healthcare and Transport** experienced inflation despite weak aggregate demand. This indicates **supply disruption–led inflation**, where logistical bottlenecks forced prices up even as the economy slowed down.

### Q5: How do Global Crude Oil prices impact domestic inflation?
**Answer:**
A strong statistical relationship (**0.97 correlation**) exists between global crude oil price movements and domestic inflation. This highlights India’s high exposure to **imported energy shocks**, making domestic prices highly sensitive to geopolitical events affecting oil supply.

## 🛠️ Analytical Approach (Brief)
- **Index-Based Analysis:** CPI treated strictly as an index to measure relative change, not additive prices.
- **Seasonality Adjustment:** YoY normalization used to remove seasonal noise from the data.
- **Sector Aggregation:** Grouped sub-sectors (e.g., "Pulses", "Vegetables") into broader categories for structural interpretation.
- **Correlation Testing:** Pearson correlation analysis used to validate global linkages with crude oil markets.

## 💡 Policy-Level Takeaway
Inflation episodes like **2019** are largely **supply-driven**, implying that **monetary tightening (raising interest rates)** is often insufficient to control them. Targeted interventions in **agriculture supply chains, logistics, and reducing energy dependency** would be more effective in stabilizing inflation than purely monetary policy.
